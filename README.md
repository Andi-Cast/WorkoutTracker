# **Workout Tracker**
### This is my first React app that I have developed. I used this experience to apply what I have learned and create something I and many gym goers would find useful. 
-----
## **Application Details**
- For this app, I wanted to create something that I would find great use in. I am someone that enjoyed weight lifting and needed something that would allow me to keep track of my workouts. I usually see people at the gym using pen and paper to track their workouts but I preferred using something more digital to keep track of all my workouts. It's easy to lose or damage a physical notebook, which is another reason I would find this app a bit more useful. 
- This app allows users to create new workouts and add/delete exercise within the individual workouts. 
- The user is also able to completely delete workouts from the workout list.
